# TreasureQuest 

This is a small and simple 2D CLI game made in C++, where you move a character in a map (I) trying to avoid enemies (O) in order to get a treasure ($). Execute move action by pressing W, A, S, or D and then ENTER (RETURN)

Compile on a Unix/Linux environment with **g++ \*.cpp** (within the _src_ folder) and run the created executable file (**./a.out**, for example). The game will ask you to input a name and start playing
